How efficient is your social media campaigns? A Python approach to gain visibility

Social media became the epicenter of advertisement for companies where there are broadly 2 approaches: 

1. Paid-content (ads that are pushed by YouTube or Instagram)
2. Branded-content (influencers)

When working with branded-content, understanding the impact and target-audience perception of the product is not always easy but this should not be a black-box. Data and most importantly data understanding is fundamental in the current everchanging world. This project intends to share a solution built focused on Locos X el Asado (www.locosxelasado.com) a grilling channel that successfully creates branded content.
